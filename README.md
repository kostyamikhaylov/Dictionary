# Dictionary
C++ class implementation using C


There are two implementations: using array (dict.c) and using list (dict2.c).
Both of them are available due to redefinition (with -D flag) in makefile.

Future developing plans:
1) To add GoodleTest unittests;
2) To create dictionary construction from file/stdin;
